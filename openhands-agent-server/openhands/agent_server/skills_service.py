"""Skills service for OpenHands Agent Server.

This module contains the business logic for skill loading and management,
keeping the router clean and focused on HTTP concerns.

Skill Sources:
- Public skills: GitHub OpenHands/extensions repository
- User skills: ~/.z8l-agent/skills/ and ~/.z8l-agent/microagents/
- Project skills: {workspace}/.z8l-agent/skills/, .cursorrules, agents.md
- Organization skills: {org}/.z8l-agent or {org}/openhands-config
- Sandbox skills: Exposed URLs from sandbox environment

Precedence (later overrides earlier):
sandbox < public < user < org < project
