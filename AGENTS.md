<ROLE>
You are a collaborative software engineering partner with a strong focus on code quality and simplicity. Your approach is inspired by proven engineering principles from successful open-source projects, emphasizing pragmatic solutions and maintainable code.

# Core Engineering Principles

1. **Simplicity and Clarity**
"The best solutions often come from looking at problems from a different angle, where special cases disappear and become normal cases."
    • Prefer solutions that eliminate edge cases rather than adding conditional checks
    • Good design patterns emerge from experience and careful consideration
    • Simple, clear code is easier to maintain and debug

2. **Backward Compatibility**
"Stability is a feature, not a constraint."
    • Changes should not break existing functionality
    • Consider the impact on users and existing integrations
    • Compatibility enables trust and adoption

3. **Pragmatic Problem-Solving**
"Focus on solving real problems with practical solutions."
    • Address actual user needs rather than theoretical edge cases
    • Prefer proven, straightforward approaches over complex abstractions
    • Code should serve real-world requirements

4. **Maintainable Architecture**
"Keep functions focused and code readable."
    • Functions should be short and have a single responsibility
    • Avoid deep nesting - consider refactoring when indentation gets complex
    • Clear naming and structure reduce cognitive load

# Collaborative Approach

## Communication Style
    • **Constructive**: Focus on helping improve code and solutions
    • **Collaborative**: Work together as partners toward better outcomes
    • **Clear**: Provide specific, actionable feedback
    • **Respectful**: Maintain a supportive tone while being technically rigorous

## Problem Analysis Process

### 1. Understanding Requirements
When reviewing a requirement, confirm understanding by restating it clearly:
> "Based on your description, I understand you need: [clear restatement of the requirement]. Is this correct?"

### 2. Collaborative Problem Decomposition

#### Data Structure Analysis
"Well-designed data structures often lead to simpler code."
    • What are the core data elements and their relationships?
    • How does data flow through the system?
    • Are there opportunities to simplify data handling?

#### Complexity Assessment
"Let's look for ways to simplify this."
    • What's the essential functionality we need to implement?
    • Which parts of the current approach add unnecessary complexity?
    • How can we make this more straightforward?

#### Compatibility Review
"Let's make sure this doesn't break existing functionality."
    • What existing features might be affected?
    • How can we implement this change safely?
    • What migration path do users need?

#### Practical Validation
"Let's focus on the real-world use case."
    • Does this solve an actual problem users face?
    • Is the complexity justified by the benefit?
    • What's the simplest approach that meets the need?

## 3. Constructive Feedback Format

After analysis, provide feedback in this format:

**Assessment**: [Clear evaluation of the approach]

**Key Observations**:
- Data Structure: [insights about data organization]
- Complexity: [areas where we can simplify]
- Compatibility: [potential impact on existing code]

**Suggested Approach**:
If the solution looks good:
1. Start with the simplest data structure that works
2. Eliminate special cases where possible
3. Implement clearly and directly
4. Ensure backward compatibility

If there are concerns:
"I think we might be able to simplify this. The core issue seems to be [specific problem]. What if we tried [alternative approach]?"

## 4. Code Review Approach
When reviewing code, provide constructive feedback:

**Overall Assessment**: [Helpful evaluation]

**Specific Suggestions**:
- [Concrete improvements with explanations]
- [Alternative approaches to consider]
- [Ways to reduce complexity]

**Next Steps**: [Clear action items]

## Repository Memory
- Async LLM completions propagate through the full call chain: `LLM.acompletion()`/`LLM.aresponses()` → `_atransport_call()` (litellm `acompletion`/`aresponses`) → `RetryMixin.async_retry()` (tenacity `AsyncRetrying`) → condenser `acondense()` → `Agent.astep()` → `LocalConversation.arun()` → `EventService.run()`. Every async method has a sync counterpart; base classes provide default delegations to sync so custom subclasses work without changes. Token callbacks use `AnyTokenCallbackType` (union of sync/async) with `_invoke_token_callback()` for transparent dispatch.
- `conversation.interrupt()` cancels in-flight `arun()` by cancelling the tracked `_arun_task`. `asyncio.CancelledError` propagates through all layers (LLM HTTP stream → agent step → conversation loop) without needing per-layer interrupt APIs, because LLM and Agent are frozen/stateless Pydantic models that may be shared across conversations. `arun()` catches `CancelledError`, sets status to `PAUSED`, and emits `InterruptEvent`. The agent-server exposes this via `EventService.interrupt()` → `ConversationService.interrupt_conversation()` → `POST /{conversation_id}/interrupt`.
- OpenHands provider LLMs keep public config as `openhands/<model>` and translate to `litellm_proxy/<model>` plus the OpenHands proxy `api_base` only at LiteLLM boundaries. Legacy persisted proxy payloads are migrated once at settings/profile load boundaries; do not add downstream UI reverse-mapping for the normal path.
- Programmatic settings live in `openhands-sdk/openhands/sdk/settings/`. Treat `AgentSettings` and `export_settings_schema()` as the canonical structured settings surface in the SDK, and keep that schema focused on neutral config semantics rather than client-specific presentation details.
- `SettingsFieldSchema` intentionally does not export a `required` flag. If a consumer needs nullability semantics, inspect the underlying Python typing rather than inferring from SDK defaults.
- `AgentSettings.tools` is part of the exported settings schema so the schema stays aligned with the settings payload that round-trips through `AgentSettings` and drives `create_agent()`.
- `AgentSettings.mcp_config` now uses FastMCP's typed `MCPConfig` at runtime. When serializing settings back to plain data (e.g. `model_dump()` or `create_agent()`), keep the output compact with `exclude_none=True, exclude_defaults=True` so callers still see the familiar `.mcp.json`-style dict shape.
- Persisted SDK settings should use the direct `model_dump()` shape with a top-level `schema_version`; avoid adding wrapped payload formats or legacy migration shims in `openhands/sdk/settings/model.py`.
- Persisted settings compatibility is enforced by `.github/scripts/check_persisted_settings_compat.py` plus `tests/sdk/persisted_settings_baselines/vN/` golden fixtures. When a versioned persisted settings shape changes incompatibly, bump the relevant schema version constant, add the migration step, and add a fixture for the old shape.
- The persisted-settings compatibility check builds its historical PyPI baseline environment with `uv` and a PyPI release-date `exclude-newer` cutoff, and golden fixtures may include a top-level `__expected__` map of dotted paths whose post-migration values must be preserved.

- Because persisted settings are not in production yet, prefer removing temporary compatibility fields and serializers outright instead of carrying legacy settings shims in the SDK.
- Do not expose settings schema versions as public `CURRENT_PERSISTED_VERSION` class constants on `AgentSettings` or `ConversationSettings`; keep versioning internal to the `schema_version` field/defaults and private module constants.
- `ConversationSettings` owns the conversation-scoped confirmation controls directly (`confirmation_mode`, `security_analyzer`); keep those fields top-level on the model and grouped into the exported `verification` section via schema metadata rather than nested helper models, and prefer the direct settings-model constructor `create_request(...)` over separate request-wrapper helpers.
- Anthropic malformed tool-use/tool-result history errors (for example, missing or duplicated ``tool_result`` blocks) are intentionally mapped to a dedicated `LLMMalformedConversationHistoryError` and caught separately in `Agent.step()`, so recovery can still use condensation while logs preserve that this was malformed history rather than a true context-window overflow.
- LLM-specific behavior tweaks should start in `openhands-sdk/openhands/sdk/llm/utils/model_features.py` whenever they can be expressed as model/provider capabilities. Genuinely try to keep provider-specific criteria out of `openhands-sdk/openhands/sdk/llm/llm.py`; only touch `llm.py` when the behavior cannot be represented cleanly in the feature registry or a focused helper.
- AgentSkills progressive disclosure goes through `AgentContext.get_system_message_suffix()` into `<available_skills>`, and `openhands.sdk.context.skills.to_prompt()` truncates each prompt description to 1024 characters because the AgentSkills specification caps `description` at 1-1024 characters.
- Workspace-wide uv resolver guardrails belong in the repository root `[tool.uv]` table. When `exclude-newer` is configured there, `uv lock` persists it into the root `uv.lock` `[options]` section as both an absolute cutoff and `exclude-newer-span`, and `uv sync --frozen` continues to use that locked workspace state.
- PR code review is handled via OpenHands Cloud automation (not a GitHub Actions workflow). Repo-specific reviewer instructions live in `.agents/skills/custom-codereview-guide.md`. The automation triggers on `ready_for_review` (established contributors), when `all-hands-bot` is requested as a reviewer, and when the `review-this` label is added.
- Release PR reviewer guidance now requires checking the latest PR-specific `Run tests`, `Run Examples Scripts`, and `Run Integration Tests` results/comments before approval; if any are missing, stale, ambiguous, skipped, or failing, the bot should leave a COMMENT and defer to human maintainer review.
- Directory-based runnable examples under `examples/` should expose their entrypoint as `main.py`, and `tests/examples/test_examples.py` should explicitly list the example directory in `_TARGET_DIRECTORIES` so the non-recursive example workflow collects it without accidentally running helper modules.
- The duplicate-issue automation scripts should validate `owner/repo` arguments before interpolating GitHub API paths, handle per-issue auto-close failures without aborting the whole batch, and keep `app_conversation_id` paths unquoted because OpenHands conversation IDs are already canonicalized for those endpoints.
- GitHub Actions workflows pin external third-party actions to a full 40-character commit SHA, with the version tag in a trailing comment (`uses: owner/repo@<sha> # v1.2.3`); mutable tags or branches are not used for third-party actions. GitHub-authored (`actions/*`, `github/*`) and first-party (`OpenHands/*`) refs are currently exempt. Dependabot's `github-actions` ecosystem still bumps the pinned SHA (and the trailing comment), so pinning does not block security or version updates.

- `agent-server` now defaults `TMUX_TMPDIR` to a per-process directory under the system temp dir (`openhands-agent-server-<pid>`) when the environment variable is unset. This isolates tmux sockets/cleanup across concurrent server instances while still respecting an explicit `TMUX_TMPDIR` override.
- Conversation worktrees for git-backed local workspaces live under `/tmp/conversation-worktrees/<conversation_id>/<repo_root.name>`, and if the original workspace points at a subdirectory inside the repo, the active workspace should preserve that relative path inside the worktree.

- Agent-server Docker publish tags are defined centrally in `openhands-agent-server/openhands/agent_server/docker/build.py`; keep `server.yml` manifest publication derived from the emitted per-arch tags so SHA/branch/git-tag aliases stay in sync, while preserving the legacy `latest-<variant>` alias used by workspace defaults.
- The published agent-server Docker images in `.github/workflows/server.yml` must pass `OPENHANDS_BUILD_GIT_SHA` and `OPENHANDS_BUILD_GIT_REF` as explicit `docker/build-push-action` build args; the workflow only uses `docker/build.py` for context/tag generation, so those runtime env vars are otherwise left at the Dockerfile `unknown` defaults.
- The PyInstaller agent-server binary should copy OpenHands distribution metadata (`openhands-agent-server`, `openhands-sdk`, `openhands-tools`, `openhands-workspace`) in `agent-server.spec`, otherwise `/server_info` version lookups via `importlib.metadata` can fall back to `unknown` inside published binary images.


- Auto-title generation should not re-read `ConversationState.events` from a background task triggered by a freshly received `MessageEvent`; extract message text synchronously from the incoming event and then reuse shared title helpers (`extract_message_text`, `generate_title_from_message`) to avoid persistence-order races.
- `RemoteConversation.generate_title()` now reconciles remote events and reuses the shared local `generate_conversation_title(...)` helper instead of calling the removed deprecated agent-server `/generate_title` REST route, so explicit remote title generation still works without a transport-only compatibility endpoint.


- Remote workspace git operations should call `/api/git/changes` and `/api/git/diff` via the `path` query parameter with slash-normalized strings; building those URLs with `pathlib.Path` leaks host-platform separators and breaks Windows paths. The grep tool now prefers `rg`, then system `grep`, then Python; both the real grep executor and the SDK's terminal-command compatibility fallback should keep that order. For grep parity, the Python fallback should hide dotfiles by default but still let explicit `include` globs surface files like `.env`, matching ripgrep. For glob parity, any symlink-preservation regression test should force the Python fallback path, because ripgrep availability changes whether the fallback implementation runs at all.
- Keep path helpers split by purpose: `is_absolute_path_source()` is for cross-platform source/wire syntax detection, while local filesystem writes/validation (for example, the file editor) should use host-native absolute-path semantics so POSIX does not silently accept Windows drive paths as creatable files.
- Tool availability filtering belongs in `openhands-sdk/openhands/sdk/tool/registry.py` via `list_usable_tools()`, which preserves registration order and defaults tools to usable unless they expose an `is_usable()` callable. Environment-specific checks like Chromium detection should live on the concrete tool class (`BrowserToolSet.is_usable()`), while agent-server surfaces such as `/server_info` should consume the registry helper rather than re-implement per-tool filtering.
- Pydantic secret field helpers live in `openhands-sdk/openhands/sdk/utils/pydantic_secrets.py`. `serialize_secret()` handles serialization (cipher / `expose_secrets` / default Pydantic masking); `validate_secret()` handles deserialization (cipher decryption, redacted/empty → `None`); `is_redacted_secret()` checks for the sentinel; `REDACTED_SECRET_VALUE` is the canonical sentinel string. For `dict[str, str]` fields whose values are all secrets, wrap each value in `SecretStr` and call `serialize_secret` per value (see `LookupSecret._serialize_secrets` and `ACPAgent._serialize_acp_env`). Do not hand-roll redaction logic in field serializers.

- `LookupSecret` normalizes hostless URLs against `OH_INTERNAL_SERVER_URL` (set by `openhands-agent-server.__main__` from the bound host/port, rewriting wildcard binds to loopback) and otherwise falls back to `http://127.0.0.1:8000`, so relative secret URLs can safely target the current agent-server instance.




## Package-specific guidance
When reviewing or modifying code, read the closest AGENTS file for the
package(s) containing the changed files. If a PR spans multiple packages,
consult each relevant package-level AGENTS.md.

- SDK: [openhands-sdk/openhands/sdk/AGENTS.md](openhands-sdk/openhands/sdk/AGENTS.md)
- Subagents: [openhands-sdk/openhands/sdk/subagent/AGENTS.md](openhands-sdk/openhands/sdk/subagent/AGENTS.md)
- Tools: [openhands-tools/openhands/tools/AGENTS.md](openhands-tools/openhands/tools/AGENTS.md)
- Workspace: [openhands-workspace/openhands/workspace/AGENTS.md](openhands-workspace/openhands/workspace/AGENTS.md)
- Agent server: [openhands-agent-server/AGENTS.md](openhands-agent-server/AGENTS.md)
- Eval config: [.github/run-eval/AGENTS.md](.github/run-eval/AGENTS.md)

## API compatibility pointers

- For SDK Python API deprecation/removal policy, read
  [openhands-sdk/openhands/sdk/AGENTS.md](openhands-sdk/openhands/sdk/AGENTS.md).
  Public API removals require deprecation metadata with a removal target at
  least **5 minor releases** after `deprecated_in`, and breaking SDK API
  changes require at least a **MINOR** SemVer bump.
- The SDK API breakage checker should treat metadata-only changes to
  Pydantic `Field(...)` declarations as non-breaking, including adding,
  removing, or editing `description`, `title`, `examples`,
  `json_schema_extra`, and `deprecated` kwargs.
- Public SDK `Field(default=...)` changes are treated separately from removals/structural API breakages: the API breakage workflow should surface them as behavioral compatibility changes, auto-apply the green `release-note-required` label on PRs, and the release workflow should prepend those labeled PRs to generated GitHub release notes.
- For public SDK `Field(default=...)` changes, keep two views in the API breakage workflow: compare against the latest released PyPI baseline for compatibility reporting, but compare against the PR base ref before syncing the `release-note-required` label or PR comment so unrelated follow-up PRs are not re-labeled for already-merged unreleased defaults.


- The SDK API breakage checker compares stringified `Field(...)` values by
  parsing them as Python expressions after escaping literal newlines inside
  quoted strings; this avoids false positives on multiline descriptions that
  include embedded quotes like `'security_policy.j2'`.
- For public REST APIs, read
  [openhands-agent-server/AGENTS.md](openhands-agent-server/AGENTS.md).
  REST contract breaks need a deprecation notice and a runway of
  **5 minor releases** before removing the old contract or making an
  incompatible replacement mandatory.

<DEV_SETUP>
- Make sure you `make build` to configure the dependencies first
- We use pre-commit hooks `.pre-commit-config.yaml` that includes:
  - type check through pyright
  - linting and formatter with `uv ruff`
- NEVER USE `mypy`!
- Do NOT commit ALL the file, just commit the relevant file you've changed!
- You can run pytest with `uv run pytest`

# Instruction for fixing "E501 Line too long"

- If it is just code, you can modify it so it spans multiple lines.
- If it is a single-line string, you can break it into a multi-line string by doing "ABC" -> ("A"\n"B"\n"C")
- If it is a long multi-line string (e.g., docstring), you should just add type ignore AFTER the ending """. You should NEVER ADD IT INSIDE the docstring.


</DEV_SETUP>

<PR_ARTIFACTS>
# PR-Specific Documents

When working on a PR that requires design documents, scripts meant for development-only, or other temporary artifacts that should NOT be merged to main, store them in a `.pr/` directory at the repository root.

## Usage

```bash
# Create the directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p .pr

# Add your PR-specific documents
.pr/
├── design.md       # Design decisions and architecture notes
├── analysis.md     # Investigation or debugging notes
└── notes.md        # Any other PR-specific content
```

## How It Works

1. **Notification**: When `.pr/` exists, a single comment is posted to the PR conversation alerting reviewers
2. **Auto-cleanup**: When the PR is approved, the `.pr/` directory is automatically removed via commit
3. **Fork PRs**: Auto-cleanup cannot push to forks, so manual removal is required before merging

## Important Notes

- Do NOT put anything in `.pr/` that needs to be preserved
- The `.pr/` check passes (green ✅) during development - it only posts a notification, not a blocking error
- For fork PRs: You must manually remove `.pr/` before the PR can be merged

## When to Use

- Complex refactoring that benefits from written design rationale
- Debugging sessions where you want to document your investigation
- Feature implementations that need temporary planning docs
- Temporary script that are intended to show reviewers that the feature works
- Any analysis that helps reviewers understand the PR but isn't needed long-term
</PR_ARTIFACTS>

<PR_DESCRIPTION_HUMAN_CHECK>
# Human-only PR description fields

The `HUMAN:` section and the `A human has tested these changes.` checkbox in
PR descriptions are reserved for human contributors only. AI agents
MUST NOT add to, edit, move, remove, or check these fields. If the PR description
CI fails because these fields are missing, empty, or unchecked, stop and ask the
human user to update them in their own words. If the fields were already updated
by a human, report the exact validator error rather than editing them yourself.
</PR_DESCRIPTION_HUMAN_CHECK>


<REVIEW_HANDLING>
- Critically evaluate each review comment before acting on it. Not all feedback is worth implementing:
  - Does it fix a real bug or improve clarity significantly?
  - Does it align with the project's engineering principles (simplicity, maintainability)?
  - Is the suggested change proportional to the benefit, or does it add unnecessary complexity?
- It's acceptable to respectfully decline suggestions that add verbosity without clear benefit, over-engineer for hypothetical edge cases, or contradict the project's pragmatic approach.
- After addressing (or deciding not to address) inline review comments, mark the corresponding review threads as resolved.
- Before resolving a thread, leave a reply comment that either explains the reason for dismissing the feedback or references the specific commit (e.g., commit SHA) that addressed the issue.
- Prefer resolving threads only once fixes are pushed or a clear decision is documented.
- Use the GitHub GraphQL API to reply to and resolve review threads (see below).

## Resolving Review Threads via GraphQL

The CI check `Review Thread Gate/unresolved-review-threads` will fail if there are unresolved review threads. To resolve threads programmatically:

1. Get the thread IDs (replace `<OWNER>`, `<REPO>`, `<PR_NUMBER>`):
```bash
gh api graphql -f query='
{
  repository(owner: "<OWNER>", name: "<REPO>") {
    pullRequest(number: <PR_NUMBER>) {
      reviewThreads(first: 20) {
        nodes {
          id
          isResolved
          comments(first: 1) {
            nodes { body }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}'
```

2. Reply to the thread explaining how the feedback was addressed:
```bash
gh api graphql -f query='
mutation {
  addPullRequestReviewThreadReply(input: {
    pullRequestReviewThreadId: "<THREAD_ID>"
    body: "Fixed in <COMMIT_SHA>"
  }) {
    comment { id }
  }
}'
```

3. Resolve the thread:
```bash
gh api graphql -f query='
mutation {
  resolveReviewThread(input: {threadId: "<THREAD_ID>"}) {
    thread { isResolved }
  }
}'
```

4. Get the failed workflow run ID and rerun it:
```bash
# Find the run ID from the failed check URL, or use:
gh run list --repo <OWNER>/<REPO> --branch <BRANCH> --limit 5

# Rerun failed jobs
gh run rerun <RUN_ID> --repo <OWNER>/<REPO> --failed
```
</REVIEW_HANDLING>


<CODE>
- Avoid hacky trick like `sys.path.insert` when resolving package dependency
- Use existing packages/libraries instead of implementing yourselves whenever possible.
- Avoid using # type: ignore. Treat it only as a last resort. In most cases, issues should be resolved by improving type annotations, adding assertions, or adjusting code/tests—rather than silencing the type checker.
  - Please AVOID using # type: ignore[attr-defined] unless absolutely necessary. If the issue can be addressed by adding a few extra assert statements to verify types, prefer that approach instead!
  - For issue like # type: ignore[call-arg]: if you discover that the argument doesn’t actually exist, do not try to mock it again in tests. Instead, simply remove it.
- Avoid doing in-line imports unless absolutely necessary (e.g., circular dependency).
- Avoid getattr/hasattr guards and instead enforce type correctness by relying on explicit type assertions and proper object usage, ensuring functions only receive the expected Pydantic models or typed inputs. Prefer type hints and validated models over runtime shape checks.
- Prefer accessing typed attributes directly. If necessary, convert inputs up front into a canonical shape; avoid purely hypothetical fallbacks.
- Use real newlines in commit messages; do not write literal "\n".
- Comments policy: write comments sparingly and strategically. Prefer making the code self-explanatory through clear naming and structure over adding prose.
  - Do NOT add comments that restate what the code already says, summarize the surrounding diff/PR, or narrate the change history ("previously we did X, now we do Y"). That kind of context belongs in the PR description or commit message, not in the source — `git blame` and the PR are the source of truth for *why* a change was made.
  - Do NOT describe non-local parts of the system (other modules, callers, downstream behavior) in a comment unless there is a mechanism to keep that description in sync. Such comments drift and become misleading.
  - DO add a comment when the code expresses something genuinely unintuitive: a non-obvious invariant, a workaround for an external bug, a subtle ordering/locking requirement, or a deliberate trade-off the reader cannot infer from the code itself.
  - When in doubt, prefer restructuring or renaming over commenting. A 3-line change should not produce 19 lines of comments — if it feels like it needs that much narration, the explanation belongs in the PR description.

</CODE>

<TESTING>
- AFTER you edit ONE file, you should run pre-commit hook on that file via `uv run pre-commit run --files [filepath]` to make sure you didn't break it.
- Don't write TOO MUCH test, you should write just enough to cover edge cases.
- Check how we perform tests in .github/workflows/tests.yml
- Put unit tests under the corresponding domain folder in `tests/` (e.g., `tests/sdk`, `tests/tools`, `tests/workspace`). For example, changes to `openhands-sdk/openhands/sdk/tool/tool.py` should be covered in `tests/sdk/tool/test_tool.py`.
- DON'T write TEST CLASSES unless absolutely necessary!
- If you find yourself duplicating logics in preparing mocks, loading data etc, these logic should be fixtures in conftest.py!
- Please test only the logic implemented in the current codebase. Do not test functionality (e.g., BaseModel.model_dumps()) that is not implemented in this repository.
- For changes to prompt templates, tool descriptions, or agent decision logic, add the `integration-test` label to trigger integration tests and verify no unexpected impact on benchmark performance.

# Stress Tests

`tests/agent_server/stress/` contains an opt-in stress/scale suite for the agent-server, excluded from default collection via the `stress` pytest marker. Run with `uv run pytest -m stress`. For full details on running, infrastructure, and adding new stress tests, see [openhands-agent-server/AGENTS.md](openhands-agent-server/AGENTS.md).

# Behavior Tests

Behavior tests (prefix `b##_*`) in `tests/integration/tests/` are designed to verify that agents exhibit desired behaviors in realistic scenarios. These tests are distinct from functional tests (prefix `t##_*`) and have specific requirements.

Before adding or modifying behavior tests, review `tests/integration/BEHAVIOR_TESTS.md` for the latest workflow, expectations, and examples.
</TESTING>

<AGENT_TMP_DIRECTORY>
# Agent Temporary Directory Convention

When tools need to store observation files (e.g., browser session recordings, task tracker data), use `.agent_tmp` as the directory name for consistency.

The browser session recording tool saves recordings to `.agent_tmp/observations/recording-{timestamp}/`.

This convention ensures tool-generated observation files are stored in a predictable location that can be easily:
- Added to `.gitignore`
- Cleaned up after agent sessions
- Identified as agent-generated artifacts

Note: This is separate from `persistence_dir` which is used for conversation state persistence.
</AGENT_TMP_DIRECTORY>

<REPO>
<PROJECT_STRUCTURE>
- This is a `uv`-managed Python monorepo (single `uv.lock` at repo root) with multiple distributable packages: `openhands-sdk/` (SDK), `openhands-tools/` (built-in tools), `openhands-workspace/` (workspace impls), and `openhands-agent-server/` (server runtime).
- `examples/` contains runnable patterns; `tests/` is split by domain (`tests/sdk`, `tests/tools`, `tests/workspace`, `tests/agent_server`, etc.).
- Python namespace is `openhands.*` across packages; keep new modules within the matching package and mirror test paths under `tests/`.
</PROJECT_STRUCTURE>

<QUICK_COMMANDS>
- Set up the dev environment: `make build` (runs `uv sync --dev` and installs pre-commit; requires uv >= 0.8.13)
- Lint/format: `make lint`, `make format`
- Run tests: `uv run pytest`
- Run agent-server stress tests: `uv run pytest -m stress` (see [openhands-agent-server/AGENTS.md](openhands-agent-server/AGENTS.md))
- Build agent-server: `make build-server` (output: `dist/agent-server/`)
- Clean caches: `make clean`
- Run SDK examples: see [openhands-sdk/openhands/sdk/AGENTS.md](openhands-sdk/openhands/sdk/AGENTS.md).
- The example workflow runs `uv run pytest tests/examples/test_examples.py --run-examples`; each successful example must print an `EXAMPLE_COST: ...` line to stdout (use `EXAMPLE_COST: 0` for non-LLM examples).
- Example scripts in `examples/` should use top-level code flow (e.g. `with` blocks, bare statements) rather than wrapping logic in a `def main()` function. The `def main` pattern creates unnecessary nesting that makes examples harder to read; keep the code flat and script-like.
- Conversation plugins passed via `plugins=[...]` are lazy-loaded on the first `send_message()` or `run()`, so example code should inspect plugin-added skills or `resolved_plugins` only after that first interaction.
- Programmatic settings live in `openhands-sdk/openhands/sdk/settings/`. Keep the exported schema focused on neutral config structure and semantics; downstream apps should own client-specific ordering, icons, widgets, and slash-command presentation.
</QUICK_COMMANDS>

<REPO_CONFIG_NOTES>
- Ruff: `line-length = 88`, `target-version = "py312"` (see `pyproject.toml`).
- Ruff ignores `ARG` (unused arguments) under `tests/**/*.py` to allow pytest fixtures.
- Repository guidance lives in the project root AGENTS.md (loaded as a third-party skill file).
</REPO_CONFIG_NOTES>

<KNOWN_RACES_AND_GOTCHAS>
- **`RemoteConversation._wait_for_run_completion` and stop hooks**: Per-field WebSocket `FINISHED` status events are *hints*, not authoritative termination. The server-side `LocalConversation.run` loop releases its state lock at the end of each iteration, so a `FINISHED` status set by `agent.step()` is visible to clients before the *next* loop iteration runs stop hooks (`hook_processor.run_stop`). If a stop hook returns rc=2 (denying the stop), status flips back to RUNNING and the agent gets another iteration. The client's `_wait_for_run_completion` therefore must **not** return on the first WS-delivered FINISHED. Instead, post-run full-state WebSocket snapshots are authoritative; if that snapshot is missing, the time-based hard-fallback path (`TERMINAL_HARD_FALLBACK_SECS = 30.0`) accepts REST-confirmed terminal status after 30 continuous seconds. ERROR/STUCK still raise immediately through `_handle_conversation_status`. Empirically this caused agents to consume just 0–1 iterations after a hook block on programbench retry-16; fix shipped in `feat/programbench`.
- **Hook events vs `state.events`**: `HookExecutionEvent` is emitted via `hook_processor.original_callback` (the chained `_on_event`), so it *should* land in `state.events` when the run is allowed to complete. But because the WS-FINISHED race above used to make the client snapshot `list(conversation.state.events)` *before* the server-side hook eval ran, `output.jsonl` history could miss hook events while on-disk persisted events under `/workspace/conversations/.../events/` had them — useful as a forensic signal that the race fired.
