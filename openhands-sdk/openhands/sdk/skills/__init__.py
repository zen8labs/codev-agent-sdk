"""Skill management for OpenHands SDK.

This module provides the unified API for working with skills:

**Core Skill Model & Loading:**
- `Skill` - The skill data model
- `SkillResources` - Resource directories for a skill (scripts/, references/, assets/)
- `load_skills_from_dir` - Load skills from a directory
- `load_project_skills` - Load skills from project's .agents/skills/
- `load_user_skills` - Load skills from ~/.z8l-agent/skills/
- `load_public_skills` - Load skills from the public OpenHands extensions repo
- `load_available_skills` - Load and merge skills from multiple sources
- `merge_skills_by_name` - Merge two skill collections by name (primary wins)

**Triggers:**
- `BaseTrigger`, `KeywordTrigger`, `TaskTrigger` - Skill activation triggers

**Installed Skills Management:**
- `install_skill` - Install a skill from a source
- `uninstall_skill` - Uninstall a skill
- `list_installed_skills` - List all installed skills
- `load_installed_skills` - Load enabled installed skills
- `enable_skill`, `disable_skill` - Toggle skill enabled state
- `update_skill` - Update an installed skill

**Types:**
- `SkillKnowledge` - Represents knowledge from a triggered skill
- `InputMetadata` - Metadata for task skill inputs

**Utilities:**
- `discover_skill_resources` - Discover resource directories in a skill
- `validate_skill_name` - Validate skill name per AgentSkills spec
- `to_prompt` - Generate XML prompt block for available skills
